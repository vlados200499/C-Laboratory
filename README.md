# C Code Samples

This repository contains C code samples for basic programming exercises. The code covers topics such as loops, input/output, conditional statements, and functions.

## LAB2

### N1

The `N1()` function prints a pattern of "O" characters in the console.

### N2

The `N2()` function takes an integer input `x` and prints a pattern of "X" characters in the console, forming a pyramid-like shape.

### N3

The `N3()` function prompts the user to input two integers `n` and `m`. It then calculates the sum of a series of mathematical expressions using nested loops and prints the result in the console.

### N4

The `N4()` function prompts the user to input an integer `a`. It then finds and prints all pairs of numbers `(i,j)` such that `1 <= i,j <= a` and `i` is a divisor of `j` and the sum of the divisors of `i` is equal to `j`.

## Usage

To run the code samples, compile and execute the `main()` function. Each function can be called independently as well.
